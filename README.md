# Annoying Fly  
I wanted to make a simple importable webpage exstion that eventualy might be something more.
For now it is an annoying fly that will attack anything you click on in your webpage.  
  
For it to work just paste this into your webpage:
>><script type="module"> import { initFly } from 'https://michaelgalloway404.github.io/AnnoyingFly/fly.js'; initFly(); </script>  

if that give you trouble just use:  
>><script type="module"> import { initFly } from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/MichaelGalloway404/AnnoyingFly@main/fly.js'; initFly(); </script>
